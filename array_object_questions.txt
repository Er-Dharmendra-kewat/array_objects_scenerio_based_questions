const visitorIds = [4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 2];


Task:
Return a list containing only unique IDs (remove duplicates).

3. Product Sorting

You get products from an API:

const products = [
  { name: "Laptop", price: 1400 },

}


where pass >= 50.

✅ Object Scenario-Based Questions
6. Merge User Profiles

Two objects represent the same user:

let employee = {
  id: 101,
  name: "John",

9. Transform Array into Object
const students = [

const transactions = [
  { type: "food", amount: 120 },
  { type: "travel", amount: 300 },
  { type: "food", amount: 80 },
];


Task:
Group by type:

{
